# Classwork:

In this Classwork, you are going to turn a simple Linux command ``grep`` into a tiny search engine. 

You have a folder ``docs`` containing ``doc1.txt`` ... `doc4.txt` (the aliens/swords/wizards/robots collection). Run everything from the parent folder. 

## Rules
- You may use `grep`, `pipes |`, `xargs`, `sort`, `uniq`, `wc`, `cat`, `tee`, `printf`, `while read`.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> No Python, no `ripgrep`, no `awk/sed`.
